        <b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated <b>JS</b>, is
        a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use
        JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often
        incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).

        The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was
        released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
        prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15]
        The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
        which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
        This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]
      </p>
      <p>
        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
        lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in
        the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene
        to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a
        scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
        this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
        language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme
        language.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
        Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to
        devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme
        or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and
        its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped
        as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
        JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it
        is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and
        Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
        marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]
      </p>

          <span>]</span>
        </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating
        in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized
        with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant
        increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node
        combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a
        stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been
        used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any
        package manager in the world.[34]
      </p>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on
        GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35]
        Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive
        proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers
        check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]
      </p>
      <p>
        The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks,
        established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript
        outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications
        and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been
        created to aid the development process.[38]

        JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C
        (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops,
        etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had
        function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript
        2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a
        distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference
        from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which
        terminate statements) to be omitted.[50

        JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly
        cast depending on the operation used.[51]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The binary <code>+</code> operator casts both operands to a string
          unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition
          operator doubles as a concatenation operator
        </li>
        <li>
          The binary <code>-</code> operator always casts both operands to a
          number
        </li>
        <li>
          Both unary operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>) always cast the
          operand to a number
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the
        strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining
        <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> functions on the
        prototype for string and number casting respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these
        conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for
        inconsistency.[52][51] For example, when adding a number to a string,
        the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but
        when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number
        before performing subtraction.

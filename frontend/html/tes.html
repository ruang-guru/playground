            <strong><a href="https:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></strong>
            <span tittle="a/in:about">is a</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"><em>Programming language</em></a> that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites
            use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
            and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        </p>

        </p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
